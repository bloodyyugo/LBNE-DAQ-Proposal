The baseline design for the LBNE DAQ \cite{DAQ_CD1}
is based on Data Concentrator Modules (DCMs) 
that were originally designed for use in the Nova experiment.
Each of these modules takes 64 input data data streams of 20 Mbps and 
combine them into a single stream of 1 Gbps. 
The total throughput of a DCM module is limited to 60 Mbytes/second.
A single DCM module is thus able to handle enough data to readout the
entire 35 ton prototype, although without a large amount of headroom.
