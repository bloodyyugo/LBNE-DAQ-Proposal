\section{Conclusions}
The SLAC DAQ Toolkit is a sophisticated and flexible platform from which
to build modern DAQ systems.
Its use in LBNE would be highly advantageous in that it would enable a highly 
flexible DAQ system with excellent performance.
This can be achieved at relatively low development cost due to the flexible 
nature of the DAQ Toolkit 
Much of the initial work on this system has already begun and is being 
supported by the SLAC LDRD.
Furthermore, the LDRD will provide the first test stand at no charge to LBNE.
